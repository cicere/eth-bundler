## üöÄ Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Sniper Bot Protection
Sniper bots can destabilize token prices by buying up tokens early. ETH Bundler prevents this by sending multiple swap transactions in a single bundle. These bundled transactions are **atomic**, meaning they either succeed or fail together, blocking sniper bots from exploiting gaps between trades.

### üè¶ Jeets (Paper Hands) Management
Short-term holders, or "jeets," often weaken token prices by selling early. ETH Bundler counters this by offering **revenue-sharing** to holders of more than 1% of the total supply, encouraging long-term investment and stabilizing the market.

### üìä Control Supply and Manage Price
ETH Bundler lets developers manage the token price by holding a significant portion of the supply. By distributing swaps across multiple wallets at launch, developers can control the market cap and guide the token's growth for a more stable and successful launch.

### üìà Low Trading Volume Solution
ETH Bundler encourages early trading by **bundling tokens** and driving liquidity from day one. It also includes the powerful **Volume Booster** feature to generate higher trading activity and boost early engagement.

### üíπ Low Market Cap at Launch
Launching with a low market cap can deter investors. ETH Bundler solves this by managing wallets and bundling transactions, creating a stronger launch with a higher market cap, which attracts more investors.

### ‚ö° Volume Booster
The **Volume Booster** feature is designed to supercharge token launches, ensuring high trading activity from the beginning. This helps attract more participants and creates excitement during launch.

## üõ†Ô∏è Wallet Setup & Requirements

To use ETH Bundler, your smart contract must include an `enableTrading` function (or similar). Here's what you need to get started:

- **Token Owner Wallet**: Used to deploy the smart contract.
- **Executor Wallet**: Distributes ETH to the recipient wallets and covers fees for ETH Bundler and the block builder.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Both wallets must be different, and each must have enough ETH to execute transactions and cover fees.

### üìù How to Get Started
1. **Prepare Both Wallets**: Ensure the Token Owner and Executor wallets have sufficient ETH.
2. **Enter Private Keys**: During the process, you'll be prompted to enter the private keys for both wallets. This verifies ownership and checks the ETH balance.
3. **Generate Bundle Wallets**: Create multiple bundle wallets, each executing swaps independently. ETH Bundler does not support importing wallets.
4. **Secure Your Data**: Store wallet information, including private keys, securely. **It's your responsibility to protect this data.**
